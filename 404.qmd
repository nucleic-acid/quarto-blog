You're sunken **404** meters below the ocean surface and there's nothing to see here.^[Actually, in the real ocean, you could still see *something*. Light travels up to 1000m below the surface. So we'd be in the "dysphotic" or twilight zone, where there is still some sunlight, but brightness decreases rapidly. So let's be honest, it'd probably be pretty dark and not very comfy. If you're really interested in more details, [this website](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/light_travel.html) might interest you.]
