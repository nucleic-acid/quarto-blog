Iâ€™m a medical doctor located in Munich (Germany), specializing in **human genetics**, where I work with rare & hereditary conditions. In my profession, I enjoy the intersection of **clinical work**, **lab work** and the **communication of scientific / medical matters** to patients and their families.

After learning the statistical / analytic tools needed for my doctorate and scientific work, I continually worked on my **visualization skills** and learned how to design charts to tell a fascinating story while maintaining accuracy in the data itself. I worked with data from many different fields and regularly participated in #TidyTuesday, #30DayChartChallenge & other data visualization challenges.

In science, I value **transparent and reproducible methods** in order to build trust and facilitate accountability/ability to detect and correct potential flaws. For the same reasons, I'm using open and reproducible tools for data visualization, such as **R/ggplot2 and Python**, whenever possible.
