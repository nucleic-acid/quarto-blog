I’m a medical doctor working in human genetics. Apart from that, I’m interested in open and reproducible research, data analysis and data visualization using open and reproducible tools, such as R and Python. This is my personal blog, where I like to share my views on topics, I’m excited about: statistics, exploring open data and the intersection of science communication, data visualization and informative illustrations.
